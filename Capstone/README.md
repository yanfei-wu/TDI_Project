# Flask on Heroku

This project is for practicing some important concepts and
technologies from the 12-day course, including Git, Flask, JSON, Pandas,
Requests, Heroku, and Bokeh for visualization.

The repository contains a Flask App that accepts stock ticker as input from the user and plots the stock price data for the last month. The finished APP can be accessed from [Heroku] (https://yanfeiwu-dataincubator-project.herokuapp.com)
