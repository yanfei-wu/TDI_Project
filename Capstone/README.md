# Flask on Heroku - Sunny Spot

This project aims to provide insights to solar installation/sales business on the geographic solar business potential in the US. In addition to factors ralated to the technological potential of solar deployment (i.e., solar radiation, rooftop areas), factors that are directly related to customers are included, such as electricity rate, income level, tax credits/incentives. Geographic visualizations of these factors are provided. These features are further combined with a historical solar installation dataset to fit regression models to predict the number of solar installations. Recommendations for the business locations are made based on the predicted number of installations.

The finished APP can be accessed from [Heroku](https://sunnyspot.herokuapp.com).
